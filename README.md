Multiple python scripts that take a single command line argument and search it on each respective website.

How to setup scripts:

1) Copy python scripts to home/bin AND home/.local/bin folders. Create one if does not exist.

2) Make scripts executable by running "chmod +x youtube.py" and "chmod +x python.py".

3) Make sure the two bin folders are added to PATH in your .bashrc file.


If none if this works then google can help you. The scripts work when you pull this repo. All you need to do is make them accessible from anywhere.
